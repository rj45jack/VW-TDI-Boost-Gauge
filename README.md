# VW-TDI-Boost-Gauge

Here you'll find information on a basic Digital Boost Gauge for a A4 VW TDI made with Arduino. This code is about 11 years old and was probably my first exposure to Adruino.

## Parts used:
* Arduino; any 16k unit should work
* HD44780 aka 1602 LCD
* Motorola, Freescale, NXP MPX4250A Pressure Sensor
* A 1999-2004.5 VW TDI
* Custom printed PCBs

## Eagle Files (PCB)
Inside the folder Eagle Files you'll see two sub folders. Here is where the "most recent" version of the PCBs exist. I'm not 100% sure if they're correct, but it's all I could find.

## How it all works
There are 2 PCBs. One is the CPU and Sensor that sits under the hood. The sensor connects to your intake system, after the turbo. This board then connects to the Display board which you place inside the car. The connection is made via Ethernet. Note that Ethernet is the cable, not the protocol used.
